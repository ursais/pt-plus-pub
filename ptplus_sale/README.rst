- Quotation and order printed reports obey the same rules that invoices do
- Quotations and orders have separate serial numbers
- Keep a copy of all printed quotations.
- Set the sequence number on quotation/order on print/confirm and not on creation.
- Prevent changes on printed/confirmed orders
- Prevent quotations/orders from being reset to the draft state.
- Quotations and orders are reported on the SAF-T file
