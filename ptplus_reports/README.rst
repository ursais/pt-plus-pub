Changelog
=========

1.4.2 (2026-08-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improvement**

- The online submission screen of the statements is now shown in Portuguese:
  the credentials of the taxpayer and of the certified accountant, the options,
  the buttons to validate, submit, consult, get the receipt, the errors and the
  payment reference, and the messages the Tax Authority sends back.

1.4.1 (2026-08-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Sending and consulting statements online now gives up after 30 seconds when
  the Tax Authority stops answering, instead of waiting indefinitely and
  keeping the server occupied.

1.4.0 (2026-08-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Online statements can now fetch the payment reference (payment guide) from the
  Tax Authority and email the Tax Authority documents (submission receipt or
  payment reference) to chosen recipients, with the PDF attached.

**Bugfixes**

- Consulting the submitted declarations online now works when it is done on
  behalf of the taxpayer by the certified accountant: the taxpayer number is now
  sent in the request, which the Tax Authority requires (it was rejected before).
- The Tax Authority error message shown after a failed submission is now
  displayed once and without raw formatting tags around the text.
- The option to email the Tax Authority documents now appears only after a
  receipt or payment reference has been fetched, not while an error is shown.

1.3.1 (2026-08-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- The Certified Accountant password is now protected also when it is filled in
  while the user is being created. Until now it was only protected when it was
  typed on an already existing user, and a password saved on the creation
  screen was kept readable and made the statement submissions fail
- When the stored Certified Accountant password cannot be read (for instance
  because it was loaded by an import), the user now gets a message asking to
  type the password again on the user form, instead of a technical error

1.3.0 (2026-07-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improvement**

- Move the AT "Obrigações Acessórias" (OA) webservice into the core: the
  ``WebserviceOA`` client and a reusable ``l10n_pt.oa.statement.mixin`` so every
  OA statement (Modelo 10, Modelo 30, DMR, ...) reuses submit / validate /
  consult / receipt / errors by implementing only ``_oa_modelo()``.

1.2.0 (2026-07-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Add the AT webservice submission core: multi-actor authentication (taxpayer +
  certified accountant) and a dedicated "Submit" step in the statement wizard
  (validate / submit online, fetch receipt), available to any statement that
  enables it.

1.0.0
