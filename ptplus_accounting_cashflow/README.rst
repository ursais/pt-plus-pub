Portugal - Cash Flow
======================

Classify the day-to-day cash movements and produce the IES cash flow statement.

* Classify bank and cash journal items over the official cash flow categories,
  splitting a single movement over several categories with exact amounts; a
  distribution below the movement amount is allowed and stays flagged as
  still to classify, but can never exceed the movement
* Classify directly on payments and when registering payments (when the
  payment moves the bank account directly), on bank transactions and on
  journal entries
* Distribution models (partner, product, account, optionally per direction)
  that classify the bank transactions automatically on reconciliation, from
  the lines of the settled documents, each document weighed by the amount
  actually reconciled with it, and classify entries posted directly against
  mapped accounts (bank fees, taxes, loans)
* A default set of distribution rules per chart of accounts (SNC Base and
  SNC Microentidades), validated by the accounting department; user-created
  rules take precedence and the defaults can be edited or archived
* Non-blocking warnings and a dedicated filter for movements still to classify;
  the statement lists the movements of the period still missing classification
* A backfill wizard (Accounting / Review / Control / Classify Cash Flows)
  that opens with every movement still to classify, pre-filled from
  the distribution models where they map and with the reconciled documents at
  hand, so the remaining movements can be classified manually in one place
* Cash Flow Statement report with the quadros Q04-B (Demonstração dos Fluxos de
  Caixa) and Q0701 (Informação adicional) of the IES Anexo A, exportable to PDF
  and XLSX, with a consistency control against the measured bank/cash balances

Installation
============

Add the module to an addons folder, restart Odoo, update the addons list and activate
it.

Configuration
=============

The classification screens are visible to the users of the "Cash Flow
Classification" group. Users of the accounting "Basic" group (community: part
of the full accounting features; enterprise: the "Invoicing & Banks" access
level) get it by default; any other user can be granted the group manually on
the user form. Note that in the community edition the accounting
Administrator level does not include "Basic", so those users also need the
manual assignment unless they have the full accounting features.

Usage
=====

The classification is available as soon as the module is installed: bank and
cash journal items can be classified over the cash flow categories on the
payment form, when registering payments, on the bank transactions and on the
journal items, the way the analytic distribution is. Movements covering more
than one nature can be split with exact amounts (e.g. a single 5.000€ payment
split between suppliers, fixed assets and loan repayments); the distribution
may stay below the movement amount — the movement is then still flagged to
classify — but can never exceed it.

Each category feeds its quadro Q04-B field and, when applicable, its quadro
Q0701 field with the same amount — the additional information of Q0701 is
about the same money. When a movement needs different amounts per quadro
(e.g. only part of a post-employment contribution belongs to "Pagamentos ao
pessoal" while the whole of it must be disclosed in Q0701), split the
movement over categories sharing the same Q0701 field but with different
Q04-B fields — new categories with the right mapping can be created in the
configuration. Differences that never touched the bank account (e.g. Q0701
dividends, which the official instructions require gross of withholding
while the statement of cash flows carries the net amount actually received)
are corrected directly on the Q0701 lines of the statement before exporting:
those lines are editable in the analysis screen.

To classify the movements of the past in bulk (e.g. right after installing
the module), use Accounting / Review / Control / Classify Cash Flows: the
wizard opens with every movement still to classify, suggests the
distribution models default where something maps, and shows the documents
behind each movement: the ones it is reconciled with, or its own journal
entry when it was booked directly against an account. On the movement
detail, each document line or direct counterpart can be classified
individually - the movement distribution then becomes the per-category sum
of the classified lines. Several ticked
movements can also be merged into a single row classified line by line;
each movement then receives the sum of its own lines. Suggestions must
be accepted (per movement, or all at once) or edited, and can be rejected;
applying only writes the accepted and edited values, leaving the rest to
classify. The same wizard can be opened for a single movement from the
journal items still to classify.

The statement is available under Accounting / Reporting / Portugal /
Financial / Cash Flow Statement: pick the period, analyze, review the warnings
(unclassified movements can be opened and fixed from the wizard) and export to
PDF or XLSX.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The IES Anexo A model produced (Portaria 35/2019, quadros Q04-B/Q0701) only
  takes effect for periods of 2026 and later; earlier periods are filed with
  the Portaria 271/2014 model (quadro 04-C), whose rubrics are equivalent but
  numbered differently. The statement warns about it.

Changelog

5.0.0 (2026-08-21)

**Features**

- Module rewritten for Odoo 19. Cash movements are now classified with a
  distribution over the cash flow categories, with exact amounts, allowing a
  single bank movement to be split over several categories. Classification is
  available on payments, when registering payments, on bank transactions and
  on journal entries, and works out of the box once the module is installed.
  When the payment does not move the bank account directly, the
  classification is done on the bank transaction instead.
- Distribution models by partner, product and account (optionally per
  direction, so one account can map receipts and payments to different
  categories): the document lines are mapped through the models and the
  classification is suggested with the sum of the line totals per category —
  pre-filled when registering a payment, and applied when a bank transaction
  or a direct-to-bank payment is reconciled with the document. On
  reconciliation each document weighs in for the amount actually matched to
  it, so a transaction covering one payment in full and another one only
  partially follows that exact split. Entries posted directly against mapped
  accounts (bank fees, taxes, loan movements) are classified on posting. The
  suggestion behaves as a default, like the analytic models: a value entered
  by the user is never overwritten.
- The module ships a default set of distribution rules per chart of accounts
  (one for SNC Base, one for SNC Microentidades, with the rules common to
  both charts shared), validated by the accounting department; each set only
  applies to companies on its chart. User-created rules take precedence over
  the defaults, and among rules on accounts the most specific account code
  wins; the defaults can be edited or archived.
- New Cash Flow Statement report producing the IES Anexo A quadros Q04-B and
  Q0701, with PDF and XLSX export, drill-down to the classified movements, a
  consistency control against the measured bank/cash balances and an
  accounting control of the class 11/12 account balances against the opening
  and closing fields of the statement.
- Backfill wizard to classify the movements of the past in bulk, pre-filled
  from the distribution models and with the reconciled documents of each
  movement at hand.
