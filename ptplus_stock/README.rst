Changelog
=========

5.1.11 (2026-09-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- The Stock Operations report no longer prints the QR code and the
  certification text. A stock operation is internal paperwork, and only the
  transport document printed from it is a fiscal document

5.1.10 (2026-07-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- The Delivery Slip (multi-way) report no longer registers its printed PDF as
  a chatter attachment

5.1.9 (2026-07-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improvement**

- The Delivery Slip (multi-way) report only shows up in the print menu when
  the picking has a source billing set

5.1.8 (2026-07-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Printed transport documents now source their loading/unloading partners from
  the same computed fields as the AT webservice communication, so an unknown
  destination is no longer rendered as the company address.

5.1.7 (2026-07-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Omit CustomerAddress and AddressTo from the AT transport document
  communication when the destination is unknown (no partner nor destination
  warehouse on the picking), instead of sending incomplete or company-fallback
  addresses; SAF-T exports report the unloading place as unknown accordingly.

5.1.6 (2026-06-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Drop the reverted per-category inventory loss account view on upgrade so the
  registry can load on databases that had the feature installed.

5.1.5 (2026-06-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improvement**

- Added the SAF-T element status as an optional column on the transfers list,
  plus list actions to (un)block and to recompute the element on the spot.

5.1.3 (2026-06-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Allow receptions to issue transport documents: selecting a document type on an incoming picking marks it as a fiscal document. Return notes (GD) apply only to deliveries, asset transport notes (GA) accept any operation except deliveries, and waybills (GT) accept internal transfers and deliveries like delivery notes.
- Report the transport movement direction following the actual goods flow, so a reception loads at the counterparty and unloads at our warehouse.

5.1.1 (2026-01-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Improvement**

- Change Inventory Statement calculation to stock move lines, and include components and products in transformation (production).


5.1.0 (2025-11-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Implement SAF-T elements logic with real-time and delayed validations.

5.0.0 (2023-11-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**
