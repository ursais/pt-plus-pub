Installation
============

Add the module to an addons folder, restart Odoo, update the addons list and
activate it.

Configuration
=============

* To allow self-billing invoices for a supplier, check its Self-billing field
  on the supplier card
* If you're planning on transmitting the self-billing invoices via webservices
  to the Tax Authority you should fill the vendor's credentials (see Roadmap)
* Create a fiscal document type for that partner's self billing invoices. Don't
  forget to check the self-billing flag and fill the self-billing partner. You
  must also create a new sequence for the vendor's self-bills.

Usage
=====

To issue and print self-billing invoices:
* On a vendor bill, activate the Self-billing option. You'll then be able to
select the fiscal document type you created on the previous step.
* Validate the invoice.
* Use the regular Print menu options to print the self-billing invoice. The
document will look as if the vendor is the issuer and your company is the customer.

To export the SAF-T file for a self-billing partner:
* Open the SAF-T PT exporting wizard
* Select Self-billing on the Type field
* Select the specific self-billing partner
* Select the dates and other usual options and export

Known issues / Roadmap
